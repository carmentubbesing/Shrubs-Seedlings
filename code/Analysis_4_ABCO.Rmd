- This is a based on some of what I learned in Analysis 2
    - for example, in terms of using VarPower
- Note: delete seedlings from PLKN and WRTS because there are only two PIPO in each
```{r, include=F}
setwd("~/Shrubs-Seedlings/Rdata")
load(file="master_data.Rdata")
library(nlme)
```

```{r}
dfABCO <- df[df$Species=="ABCO" & !df$Fire %in% c("PLKN","FRDS"),]
varPower <- varPower(form=~Ht.cm)
M1F.abco <- gls(LastYearGrth.cm ~ Ht.cm + Cov1.2 + BasDia.cm + Ht1 + IAG + Fire + FIre*Ht.cm,
                weights = varPower,
                 data= dfABCO, method = "ML")
anova(M1F.abco)
