# This script runs simulations without being spatially explicit. Thus, the functions `shrubclump` and `ratify_r` were removed.

```{r, include = F}
setwd("~/Shrubs-Seedlings/code/Simulations/") # change this if needed
pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "sf", "knitr", "mgcv", "gridExtra", "doParallel")
lapply(pkgs, require, character.only = T)
strt <- Sys.time()
```

#### Iteration function
```{r}
print(Sys.time())
source("functions/iterate.R")
```

# Define stuff

## Define iterations
```{r}
iterations <- 10
```

## Define length of simulation
```{r}
years_max <- 40
```

## Define fire
```{r}
fire <- "AMRC"
```

## Climate method and conifer species method
```{r}
climate_method <- "uniform_2015"
conifer_species_method <- "random"
```

# Iterate 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
time <- Sys.time()
dfsimallreps <- iterate(iterations, fire, years_max, climate_method, conifer_species_method)
print(paste("That took"))
Sys.time()-time
```

# Save results
```{r}
filename <-  paste("~/Simulations",  Sys.Date(), "_", iterations, fire,"_", conifer_species_method, ".Rdata", sep = "")
save(dfsimallreps, file =filename)
```

```{r, echo = F}
if(nrow(dfsimallreps)==iterations){
  print("ALERT! Something went wrong.")
}
```

# Filter out years in which nothing happens
```{r}
max_year <- dfsimallreps %>% 
  group_by(Years, emerged) %>% 
  summarize(sum_emerged = sum(emerged)) %>% 
  filter(emerged ==0) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  summarize(max_year = max(Years)) %>% 
  unlist()
```

```{r}
dfsimallreps <- dfsimallreps %>% 
  filter(Years < max_year+2)
```

```{r}
print(paste("The whole thing took"))
round(Sys.time()-strt)
Sys.time()
```

# Save results
```{r}
filename <-  paste("~/Simulations",  Sys.Date(), "_", iterations, fire,".Rdata", sep = "")
save(dfsimallreps, file =filename)
```
