# Summary
This repository holds the code for analyzing Carmen's summer 2016-2017 shrub and seedling measurements and other data related to the interactions between shrubs and conifer seedlings. The data being analyzed is located in Stephens lab dropbox -> SORTIE -> Shrubs_Summer16 -> Shrubs2016_Completed_Data_and_Photos

# Fire Footprint seedling growth in relation to shrubs (2016 and 2017 data)

## Concerns

Some seedlings have diameter measurements that are smaller in 2017 than in 2016. For some seedlings, the difference is small enough that it could be a measurement error, such as the calipers not being perfect or people measuring on the wrong side of the tree. However, for some seedlings the differences are large and it seems that the error could be due to a serious mistake, like measuring the wrong tree or writing down the number wrong. 

Thoughts on how to deal with this problem:

  - Since only 1 measurement was taken in 2016 and 2 were taken in 2017, for trees with diameter measurements smaller in 2017 than 2016 I could potentially use just the smaller of the two measurements from 2017, though that won't help much since many seedlings have two very similar measurements in 2017, and that logic would be hard to apply to seedlings without this problem. 


## Data processing 

- cleaning and consolidating into one table is done in the files `clean_combine_2016-only.Rmd` and `clean_combine_2016-2017.Rmd`

## Analysis 

Controlled variables:

- Since this is a repeated measures analysis, **seedling** was included as a random effect in all models
- **Fire** was also included as a random effect in all models
- **Year** was included as a fixed effect for all models

To the above fixed and random effects, I tried all possible combinations of the following variables:

2. ShrG1: Most abundant shrub genus within 1 m from seedling
3. IAG: Shrub genus immediately above seedling
6. Cov1: Total cover of shrubs 0-1 m from seedling
7. Cov1.2: Total cover of shrubs 0-2 m from seedling
8. Cov1.3: Total cover of shrubs 0-3 m from seedling
13. Ht1: Average shrub height 0-1 m from seedling
14. Ht1.2: Average shrub height 0-2 m from seedling
15. Ht1.3: Average shrub height 0-3 m from seedling
3. shrubarea1: Cov1*Ht1, square root transformed
4. shrubarea2: Cov1.2*Ht1.2, square root transformed
5. shrubarea3: Cov1.3*Ht1.3, square root transformed
12. Seedling species
16. Slope/aspect
17. BasDia2017.mm.ave: Seedling diameter (average of the two measurements taken in 2017)
18. Ht_cm: Seedling total height

And the following interactions:

1. Ht_cm * Ht1.3
2. Cov1.3 * Ht1.3
3. Species * sqrt(shrubarea3)

- I excluded redundant combinations of variables/interactions (such as including Cov1 and Cov1.2 or including shrub cover, height, and cover*height)
- I calculated AIC for models with all of the possible variable and interaction combinations and found the model with the best AIC


The best model turned out to be:

```{r, eval = F}
lme(VertGrowth_Rel ~  Year + sqrt(shrubarea3), data = df, random = list(~ 1| Fire,~1| Sdlg))
```

For that model, and created a figure of predicted values for a fictional set of data spanning the actual range of shrub measurements, and for all fires and years:

## Next steps

1. figure out how to normalize in the sense of subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation when I'm then going to take the square root of the variable
    - square root first? 
    - check in Zuur book

2. add elevation and slope data in a synthetic variable, and delete fire random effect
