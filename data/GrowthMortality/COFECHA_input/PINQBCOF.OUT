 For each series with potential problems the following diagnostics may appear:

 [A] Correlations with master dating series of flagged  50-year segments of series filtered with  32-year spline,
     at every point from ten years earlier (-10) to ten years later (+10) than dated

 [B] Effect of those data values which most lower or raise correlation with master series
     Symbol following year indicates value in series is greater (>) or lesser (<) than master series value

 [C] Year-to-year changes very different from the mean change in other series

 [D] Absent rings (zero values)

 [E] Values which are statistical outliers from mean for the year
